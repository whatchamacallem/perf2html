test_expected_behavior.sh [debug-flags] [--check-formatting]
    Formats, lints and scans the files scripts/test_whitelist.txt lists,
    runs perf2html_batch.sh over the three reports it cleared, then
    validates and screenshots what it wrote. Any fault stops the run where
    it happened.
    --check-formatting  Report what would change rather than writing it.

    These are the same debug-flags as the README.md documents:
    --keep-artifacts    Measure as usual, but keep the recordings afterwards,
                        which is what a later --regenerate reuses. Flagless
                        runs delete them.
    --regenerate        Rebuild the three reports' pages from the last run's
                        recordings, re-measuring nothing. Pass it after every
                        dev/ edit; leave it off once perf has been re-linked.
                        Recordings that no longer describe the executable are
                        a hard error: re-run without the flag to measure.
    --verbose           Enables diagnostic information. Repeating it (--verbose
                        --verbose) increments the verbosity level.
